# Pencilooza

Created as part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application), Pencilooza is a mock inventory/application management application intended to provide foundational experience and knowledge in creating and structuring an express application. Some of the core concepts include routing, form sanitization and validation, Mongoose/MongoDB communication and management, and much more.
